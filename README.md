Use raspberry for a2dp-bluetooth music streaming

All the work was done by:
- Martin Engstr√∂m (original BitBucket repository)
- Aden Beckitt (2017 Raspbian Jessie rewrite)
- Brett Reinhard (2017 Raspbian Jessie minimal rewrite, added features)


I did some fixes for the bluetooth-streaming (Volumio) installation that worked for me.
